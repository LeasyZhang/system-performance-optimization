# Optimize performance by increasing CPU cache hit

## CPU multiple cache

- Level 1: 32KB, closest to CPU, every cpu has a level 1 cache
- Level 2: 256KB, every CPU has level 2 cache
- Level 3: 20MB, shared between CPUs

## Increase data cache hit ratio

- CPU cache line(64 byte in general)

## Increase order cache hit ratio

- CPU branch predicator

## Increase cache hit ratio under multiple CPUs

- bind a process or thread to a CPU
